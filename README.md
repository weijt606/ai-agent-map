AI Agent Map is a practical, visual-first guide for comparing mainstream AI agents, agent platforms, runtimes, and orchestration tools.

The goal is simple: help readers get to a sensible shortlist faster.

## What This Repo Is For

- The agent landscape is crowded.
- Many resources explain ideas, but not fit, anti-fit, or operating cost.
- People usually need a comparison layer, not another pile of links.

This repo stays focused on selection: what a system is good at, where it breaks down, and what kind of operator cost comes with it.

## Where To Start

| If your question is... | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| I need a shortlist first | [![Open agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/OPEN-AGENTS-d97706?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=92400e)](agents/README.md) |
| I need help choosing for coding automation | [![Read coding guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/READ-CODING%20GUIDE-2563eb?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=1d4ed8)](use-cases/coding-automation.md) |
| I already have candidates and want a side-by-side view | [![View mainstream matrix](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIEW-MAINSTREAM%20MATRIX-dc2626?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=991b1b)](comparisons/mainstream-agent-landscape.md) |
| I care about dimensions like approval, memory, scheduling, and deployment | [![Browse capabilities](https://img.shields.io/badge/BROWSE-CAPABILITIES-16a34a?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=166534)](capabilities/README.md) |

## Recent Heat Ranking

Popularity is not fit.

This table tracks projects that showed up as especially hot in a recent April 2026 GitHub snapshot. The rank follows that snapshot. The total star counts below were checked when this repo was updated.

| Rank | Project | Current stars | Snapshot gain | Map status | How to read it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | [Hermes Agent](agents/hermes-agent.md) | 55.9k | +14,811 | In scope | Self-hosted multi-agent environment with real momentum and clear fit in this repo |
| #2 | [OpenScreen](https://github.com/siddharthvaddem/openscreen) | 27.9k | +13,938 | Out of scope | Very hot, but it is a screen-demo tool rather than an agent |
| #3 | [oh-my-codex](agents/oh-my-codex.md) | 20.9k | +11,503 | In scope | A Codex workflow and orchestration layer that is rising quickly |
| #4 | [AI Edge Gallery](agents/ai-edge-gallery.md) | 20.3k | +3,796 | In scope with caveat | More of an on-device assistant sandbox than a coding-first agent |
| #5 | [oh-my-claudecode](agents/oh-my-claudecode.md) | 27.6k | +5,935 | In scope | A fast-moving orchestration layer around Claude Code |

- Heat is useful for discovery, not for selection by itself.
- Some hot repos are adjacent to the agent landscape without actually being agents. OpenScreen is the clearest example in this snapshot.
